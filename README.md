Customer Segmentation Project
Introduction
This project aims to segment customers of a retail store using K-means clustering based on their demographic and spending behavior. The dataset includes information such as Customer ID, age, gender, annual income, and spending score.

Files
.customer_data.csv: CSV file containing the customer data.

.customer_segmentation.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis and clustering.

Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required to run the code:

.pandas

.matplotlib

.scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip: pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

Usage
1.Clone the repository or download the files to your local machine.

2.Open the Jupyter Notebook customer_segmentation.ipynb in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook.

3.Run each cell in the notebook to load the data, perform data analysis, and apply K-means clustering.

4.Analyze the clusters and interpret the results based on customer segments.

Data Description
.Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.

.Age: Age of the customer.

.Gender: Gender of the customer (Male/Female).

.Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.

.Spending Score (1-100): Spending score assigned to the customer based on purchasing behavior and other factors.

Results
The project will generate clusters of customers based on their annual income and spending score. These clusters can be used to identify target customer segments and plan marketing strategies accordingly.
